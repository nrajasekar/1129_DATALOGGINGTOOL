6.	About (Short Description / Summary): This assignment presents a framework for developing an application tool 
	for data logging applications in Aakash tablet. Proposed application tool for Aakash tablet provides different options 
	such as stand alone or remote data logging facility with manual or automated input using Bluetooth,               
	 Wi-Fi connections. This application tool will present a new approach to perform typical laboratory experiments 
	for the engineering students, using the Aakash tablet as a data logging device.

7.	Install (Installation procedure): Load the server file in the Aakash tablet, Connect the sensors with a Arudino micro controller with bluetooth module,
	Configure the serial port blue tooth configuration to receive the data in a Laptap,  Use WIFI option to configure the connection between the laptap
	and the Aakash tablet to log the data.
